        <h3>The Chili my Dad Taught Me</h3>
        <p>My dad's chili is a fairly simple recipe. It has only a few ingredients and is very simple to make.</p>
        <p>I remember him making this frequently and I'm happy to share this recipe for you all as well.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ground Beef</li>
                <li>Pasta Shells</li>
                <li>Canned Diced Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Salt (lots of salt!)</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>How to Make My Dad's Chili:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start a pot of boiling water for the shells; sprinkle some salt into the pot.</li>
                <li>While the water is boiling; cook the ground beef; season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Once the water has come to boil: insert the pasta into the pot and let cook for 6-8 minutes.</li>
                <li>When the beef has begun to brown, add the can of diced tomatoes. One can is enough, unless you like extra tomatoes in your dish.</li>
                <li>After your pasta and beef with the tomatoes has been cooked thoroughly, plate the shells (we always used bowls) and top with the ground beef and tomatoes.</li>
                <li>Congrats! You have completed the dish! Now, will you be using a fork or a shovel?</li>
            </ol>
