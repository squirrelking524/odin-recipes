Odin Recipes: testing my ability to code.

The following is a list of three of my favorite recipes. This was a really great way to learn to code my first real website and also share a little about me.

A couple of struggles I had were links. Linking to my recipe docs and back to the home page. Found that I needed to, on more than one occasion, list the file those docs were in. My images didn't always come through the first time as well. I also had to double check my file route and add what file name those images were stored. 

Overall, it was a great practice to test what I knew and learning to problem solve my issues.

A couple of areas I want to improve:
    1. Knowing when the commit and learning to comment better. I feel like I would complete a page and then commit. Or just fix a link, add more to a page, then commit without committing when I fixed my link and adding the appropriate comment. I would like to try to improve at this a little more.
    2. Learning href and src link structures. I need to keep up with this area in order to not always create bad links.
    3. Adding more recipes. I would like to continue to make this more my own. I choose fairly simple and straightforward recipes in order to not focus so much on the food but the code. Now that I've completed this, I would like to add some more in-depth recipes where cooking meat requires it's own step by step guide, or how to make the seasonings, etc.
